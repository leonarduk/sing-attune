#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Runs a command (typically a pip install) with git credentials configured so it
# can clone the now-private leonarduk/cicaid-core repo. leonarduk/cicaid was
# renamed to leonarduk/cicaid-core (private) and its old name reused by a new,
# unrelated public repo, so old github.com/leonarduk/cicaid/releases/... wheel
# URLs are not a durable source for cicaid-devtools (issue #388).
#
# Fails fast with an actionable message if CICAID_CORE_TOKEN is unset or empty,
# instead of letting the wrapped command fail later with a confusing git auth
# error. The credential rewrite is scoped to exactly this invocation through
# Git's GIT_CONFIG_* environment variables; the token is never written to a
# config file.
#
# Uses `url.<base>.insteadOf` with the token embedded as URL userinfo, rather
# than a `credential.<url>.helper` shell snippet that reads the token from the
# env var at request time. The helper form looks more secure on paper (the raw
# token never touches disk), but empirically it is NOT reliable here: any
# pre-existing generic `credential.helper` (e.g. Git Credential Manager, or a
# local `gh auth login`) is consulted first and can supply -- or fail to yield
# to -- a different credential before a URL-scoped helper ever runs, since
# helpers accumulate across config scopes rather than "most specific wins".
# The `insteadOf` rewrite has no such ambiguity: the token is embedded
# directly in the URL, which git's transport layer uses unconditionally
# without consulting the credential-helper chain at all. GitHub's own PAT
# formats (ghp_/github_pat_/gho_/ghs_/ghr_) are always alphanumeric and never
# contain the URL-reserved characters (@, :, /) that would make this rewrite
# unsafe, so that's not a practical concern for the token this script expects.
#
# Usage: pip_install_cicaid_core.sh <command...>
# Required env: CICAID_CORE_TOKEN
